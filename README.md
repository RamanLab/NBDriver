## Description
Using missense mutation data from experimental assays, we build a binary classifier by extracting features from the neighborhood sequences of driver and passenger mutations. Our key results are three-fold. First, we use generative models to derive the distances between the underlying probability estimates of the neighborhood sequences for the two classes of mutations. Then, we build robust classification models using repeated cross-validation experiments to derive the median values of the metrics designed to estimate the classification performances. Finally, we demonstrate our modelsâ€™ ability to predict unseen coding mutations from independent test datasets derived from large mutational databases. 

## Overall Workflow of NBDriver
The Brown et al. dataset was used as training data for our analysis. Raw nucleotide sequences surrounding the mutations published in this study were extracted from the reference genome build GRCH37. Then, seven feature representations, namely, TFIDF Vectorizer (*k*-mer sizes 2,3 and 4), Count Vectorizer (*k*-mer sizes 2,3 and 4) and One-hot encoding were used to convert the string-based features to numerical formats. This was followed by estimating the underlying probability distributions using kernel density estimation and repeated cross-validation experiments using Random Forests, KDE classifer and Extra Trees classifier. The final model (NBDriver) was obtained using a training set derived after removing all overalapping mutations between Brown et al. and an independent test set published by Martelotto et al. Subsequent validation with four separate independent validation sets containing pathogenic data from landamrk studies was also performed to judge the ability of NBDriver in predicting unseen test instances. The overall workflow is summarized below.
